        "José Gregorio Hernández Cisneros was born on October 26, 1864, in Isnotú, a small town nestled in the Andes of the state of Trujillo, Venezuela. His father, Benigno María Hernández, was a merchant of Spanish descent. His mother, Josefa Antonia Cisneros, a descendant of Canary Island emigrants, taught him his first letters and planted a deep faith in his heart.",
        "Unlike other children, young José Gregorio preferred reading the lives of the saints and Thomas à Kempis's book to playing. That seriousness was not sadness: it was already the seed of an extraordinary vocation.",
        "At the age of eight, he lost his mother. His aunt María Luisa took on the maternal role. At thirteen, he left the Andean mountains and traveled alone to Caracas to study at the prestigious Colegio Villegas. In 1882, he earned his Bachelor's degree in Philosophy."

On June 29, 1888, he received his Doctor of Medical Sciences degree with honors. The rector told him at the ceremony words that proved prophetic: 'Venezuela and medicine expect great things from you, Dr. Hernández.'"

        "The Venezuelan government awarded him a scholarship to study in Europe. In Paris, he trained in the laboratories of Charles Robert Richet (future Nobel laureate in Physiology), Mathias Duval, and under the direction of Isidore Straus, a disciple of Émile Roux, who was in turn a disciple of Louis Pasteur. The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris awarded him a medal for his performance. He also studied in Berlin, taking courses in histology, pathological anatomy, and bacteriology.",
        "He spoke Spanish, French, German, English, Italian, Portuguese, and Latin fluently.",
        "He returned to Venezuela in November 1891 carrying microscopes — among the first used in Venezuelan science — and the design for a laboratory inspired by the Paris School of Medicine."

He later added Parasitology and Pathological Anatomy. Simultaneously, he created the UCV's Laboratory of Experimental Physiology.",
        "For nearly 30 years (1891–1919) he served as a university professor. In 1904, he was one of the 35 founding members of the National Academy of Medicine of Venezuela. He published Elementos de Bacteriología (1906/1908), the first bacteriology book published in Venezuela, and Elementos de Filosofía (1912). He was a pioneer in alerting the country about schistosomiasis, describing the first seven documented cases.",
        "But his greatest legacy was not in books."

He kept a bag hanging by his door — 'the poor box' — where patients could take or leave money discreetly, without the embarrassment of admitting they had no resources.",
        "He explained to his aunt María Luisa: 'Most of these people have no means; I will not deny them a consultation, and I will not make them go through the embarrassment of telling me they have no money. God will provide.'",
        "During the devastating Spanish flu epidemic of 1918, he tirelessly treated the infected in Caracas. He also worked at the Orphanage of Divine Providence. The people gave him the name that would define him forever: the Doctor of the Poor."

        "In 1899, he became a Secular Franciscan (Third Order of St. Francis). His daily life reflected a deep devotion: he rose before 5 a.m., prayed the Angelus, attended Mass at the church of La Divina Pastora, and received communion daily.",
        "But he felt God was asking more of him.",
        "In July 1908, at the age of 43, he entered the Charterhouse of Farneta, near Lucca, Italy, to become a Carthusian monk. He took the name 'Brother Marcelo.' The extreme austerity destroyed his health, and the prior forced him to leave in April 1909. In 1913, he tried again, enrolling at the Pontifical Latin American College in Rome to study theology. The Roman climate caused a pulmonary illness that forced him to return to Venezuela.",
        "After these two attempts, he understood that his path was not the monastery: it was lay apostolate through medicine. To serve God by healing the poor."

That morning, he told a friend he was happy because the Treaty of Versailles had been signed the day before. He had offered his life in prayer for world peace.",
        "Around 1:30 in the afternoon, a neighbor asked him to help a gravely ill elderly woman. José Gregorio immediately grabbed his medical bag and stopped at the Botica de Amadores to buy the medicines the woman could not afford. Upon leaving, at the corner of Amadores and Urapal, in the La Pastora neighborhood, a streetcar was stopped between the streets. As he crossed in front of it, he did not see a 1918 Essex automobile approaching at about 30 km/h from behind the streetcar.",
        "The impact threw him into the air. His head struck the edge of the curb. His last words were: 'Blessed Virgin!'",
        "He was taken to Hospital Vargas, where Dr. Luis Razetti was on duty. But José Gregorio arrived lifeless. The cause of death: fracture of the base of the skull with cerebral hemorrhage.",
        "He was 54 years old. He died as he lived: on his way to tend to a sick, poor person, carrying medicines he had paid for himself."

        "The crowd seized the coffin from the pallbearers and carried it themselves through the streets, shouting: 'Doctor Hernández belongs to us!'",
        "The family did not seek punishment for the driver. They called the accident 'an unforeseen event without criminal intent.' That gesture of forgiveness, in a moment of immense grief, reflected exactly the values José Gregorio had taught them."

        "Thus, the two most venerated saints of Venezuela and Ecuador are united by blood and by faith."
