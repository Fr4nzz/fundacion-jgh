      "The beatification Mass was celebrated on April 30, 2021, at the church of San Juan Bautista de La Salle in Caracas. Due to pandemic restrictions, only about 150 people could attend in person, but thousands of Venezuelans gathered in Plaza La Candelaria to follow the ceremony on giant screens.",
      "Pope Francis sent a video message in which he said: 'I know how many years you have waited for the moment when the Church would confirm something you firmly believed: that the people's doctor is close to God.' He called him 'a model of holiness committed to the defense of life... a paradigm of service to others, like a Good Samaritan, excluding no one.'",
      "Yaxury Solórzano, the girl whose miraculous healing made the beatification possible, attended the ceremony with her mother. She was then 14 years old."

      "On October 19, 2025, before some 70,000 people in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican — including 3,000 Venezuelan pilgrims — Pope Leo XIV proclaimed José Gregorio Hernández a saint, calling him a 'benefactor of humanity.' The canonization was carried out through the equipollent route (equivalent canonization): Pope Francis recognized that the prolonged and uninterrupted devotion of the people, his heroic virtues, and his unbroken reputation for intercession were sufficient to declare his sainthood.",
      "In Caracas, thousands gathered from the early morning hours in Plaza La Candelaria to follow the ceremony on a giant screen, with singing, fireworks, and testimonies of faith. The Venezuelan government declared October 19 and 20 as non-working days in honor of the canonization.",
      "Together with Carmen Elena Rendiles Martínez, they became the first two saints of Venezuela. The Archbishop of Caracas, Raúl Biord Castillo, declared: 'Venezuelan migration has carried José Gregorio everywhere. In many cities across Latin America, José Gregorio will be celebrated. He is a Latin American saint.'",
      "A note for Ecuador: In the same canonization ceremony, Sor María Troncatti was also proclaimed a saint — a Salesian missionary who served for decades in the Ecuadorian Amazon — the same region where our Foundation operates in Archidona, Napo."

      "The canonization of José Gregorio Hernández is a powerful message for our time: you can be a saint as a layperson, as a scientist, as a doctor. He did not need a pulpit or a monastery. His altar was the bedside of the sick. His sermon was the stethoscope. His sacrifice was paying out of his own pocket for the medicines the poor could not afford.",
      "In a world where science and faith seem at odds, San José Gregorio reminds us that they are one and the same: seeking the truth in order to serve others."
