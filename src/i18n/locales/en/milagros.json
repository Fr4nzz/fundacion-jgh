        "On March 10, 2017, in the state of Guárico, Venezuela, Yaxury Solórzano Ortega, a 10-year-old girl, was shot in the head during a robbery. Multiple pellets struck the right temporoparietal region, causing loss of brain matter, bone loss, and severe hemorrhaging.",
        "She was transported for over four hours along difficult roads to the Hospital Pablo Acosta Ortiz in San Fernando de Apure. No neurosurgeon was available. She waited 48 hours before being operated on — far beyond the critical 'golden hour.' The neurosurgeon who finally operated on her, Dr. Alexander Krinitzky, later stated: 'Scientifically, the wound was fatal from the start.'",
        "Her mother, Carmen Ortega, immediately began praying to José Gregorio Hernández. During the surgery, she recounts feeling a hand on her shoulder and hearing a voice that told her: 'Be at peace, everything will be all right.' She also recounts seeing the figure of Hernández in the hospital room.",
        "On the fourth day after surgery, Yaxury began responding positively to all tests. Within 20 days, she walked out of the hospital completely healed, speaking normally, with no permanent neurological impairment.",
        "The Vatican's medical commission, composed of seven doctors, unanimously confirmed in January 2020 that the healing had no scientific explanation."

        "His family prayed for eight consecutive days to José Gregorio Hernández. Morales reported seeing the image of José Gregorio twice during his coma. Within a week, he began recovering at a pace that astonished the medical team. In 2022, the Archdiocese of Miami certified that the recovery had no scientific explanation.",
