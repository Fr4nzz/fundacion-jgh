      "San José Gregorio Hernández dedicated his life to healing those who could not pay. He bought medicines with his own money. He walked through the rain to visit the sick in their homes. He never charged a poor patient.",
      "He died on his way to tend to a sick elderly woman, carrying medicines he had just bought himself.",
      "That charity did not die with him. It lives on in every person who chooses to serve others in his name.",
      "The Fundación Santísima Trinidad Dr. José Gregorio Hernández 3M was legally established in 2021 (Acuerdo Ministerial No. MIES-2021-036) — the same year the Doctor was beatified — with the purpose of improving the living conditions of those most in need in the Ecuadorian Amazon. From our headquarters in Archidona, province of Napo, we work so that those seeking relief from their physical ailments, and above all from ailments of the soul, may find in prayer and the intercession of 'Hermanito Gregorio' the strength they need.",
      "With a presence at three offices nationwide — Archidona, Riobamba, and Quito — our Foundation keeps alive the legacy of the holy Doctor of the Poor."

      "Few know that San José Gregorio Hernández has a blood tie to Ecuador. Through the Febres-Cordero family, who migrated from Venezuela, José Gregorio was a third cousin of Santo Hermano Miguel — Ecuador's only canonized saint — and a fourth-degree uncle of former president León Febres-Cordero Ribadeneyra.[2][3]",
      "Devotion to José Gregorio Hernández in Ecuador has deep roots: since 1982, the San Antonio de Padua Parish in Guayaquil has maintained a space dedicated to his veneration. Our Foundation operates from three offices nationwide — Archidona, Riobamba, and Quito — bringing the faith and charity of 'Hermanito Gregorio' to the corners of the Amazon and beyond.[1]",
